Windows 11-Inspired Calculator Project
Project Overview
This project is a Java-based calculator application that emulates the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Windows 11 calculator. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing calculator application while giving the developer, a software engineering student, an opportunity to practice GUI programming and event handling in Java.

Features
Windows 11-inspired design: The calculator's user interface mimics the sleek and modern design of the Windows 11 calculator app.
Basic arithmetic operations: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Scientific mode (optional): The calculator may include a scientific mode with advanced mathematical functions.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code.
Basic understanding of Java Swing for GUI development.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
[git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-project.git](https://github.com/ablixM/ProjectCalculate.git)
Open the project in your preferred IDE.

Usage
Open the project in your IDE.

Locate the main Java file that contains the entry point for the calculator application (e.g., CalculatorApp.java).

Run the application.

The calculator's GUI should appear, allowing you to perform basic arithmetic operations.
